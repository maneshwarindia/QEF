# Exercise 1: preparing QE (CPU version)

We will first prepare an HPC ready installation of QE. This exercise will show how to compile QE and check for relevant libraries in the context of standard and accelerated systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

First connect to the Marconi100 HPC cluster: 

~~~~~{.bash}
ssh USER@login01-ext.m100.cineca.it  
~~~~~

with the password you find on the Slack workspace.

Due to the particular configuration of this cluster, it is convenient to work in the directory $CINECA_SCRATCH.

For this reason, once you are logged in the cluster, run these commands 

~~~~~{.bash}
cd materials-for-max-qe2021-online-school/  
git pull  
cp -r   Day-9/  $CINECA_SCRATCH  
cd $CINECA_SCRATCH  
cd Day-9/
pwd
~~~~~

to copy the folder materials-for-max-qe2021-online-school/Day-9/ to $CINECA_SCRATCH and move inside the Day-9 folder inside $CINECA_SCRATCH.
You can check that pwd returns this directory:

/m100_scratch/usertrain/USER/Day-9 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download the last release of QE, extract it and rename it with the commands below:

~~~~~{.bash}
cd exercise1.CPU-setup/ 
wget https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/archive/qe-6.7MaX-Release/q-e-qe-6.7MaX-Release.tar.bz2
tar xjf q-e-qe-6.7MaX-Release.tar.bz2
mv q-e-qe-6.7MaX-Release qe-cpu
cd qe-cpu
~~~~~

*Note:* for the copy-paste friendly version, open the `README.md` file in each directory. Alternatively you can [click here](https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/releases) to jump to the web-page with QE releases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the CPU version we will use hpc-sdk and SpectrumMPI which are a good combination for the OpenPower machines of Marconi100.
The FFTW library is also required. The environment is setup using the following modules. 

~~~~~{.bash}
module purge
module load hpc-sdk/2020--binary spectrum_mpi/10.3.1--binary fftw/3.3.8--spectrum_mpi--10.3.1--binary  
~~~~~

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configure QE with the following option, that will select nvfortran compilers from the hpc-sdk package and SpectrumMPI

~~~~~{.bash}
./configure  MPIF90=mpipgifort
~~~~~

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **...check that relevant libraries have been detected**, namely on this system, blas, lapack from hpc-sdk and fftw3:

~~~~~{.bash}
    The following libraries have been found:
       BLAS_LIBS=-lblas 
       LAPACK_LIBS=-L/cineca/prod/opt/compilers/hpc-sdk/2020/binary/Linux_ppc64le/2020/profilers/Nsight_Systems/host-linux-ppc64le -llapack -lblas 
       FFT_LIBS= -lfftw3 
~~~~~

*Note:* we did not enable OpenMP in this case since we will be dealing with small input files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will only benchmark `pw.x`. Let's compile it with the command

    make -j4 pw

Now enjoy an espresso while you wait 3 minutes or so.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check that your installation works by running in parallel a quick random test from the test-suite

    mpirun -np 2 PW/src/pw.x   -inp test-suite/pw_dft/dft1.in


You should find this error:

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Error in routine readpp (2):
     file /m100/home/usertrain/a08trd1e/espresso/pseudo/Si.pz-vbc.UPF not found
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

because it cannot find the pseudopotential, but it is fine because it means that the installation was successfully done.
