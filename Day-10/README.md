https://aiida-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/tutorial-qe-short/

For the Quantum ESPRESSO school, an AiiDAlab kubernetes cluster will be deployed the day before the AiiDA tutorial. Details on how to connect will be on the landing page of the above link one week before the event. However, if you're eager to get started, you can do so with the instructions on the page using either the [Quantum Mobile](https://quantum-mobile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/both/21.03.18-qe.html) or the [AiiDAlab demo cluster](https://aiidalab-demo.materialscloud.org/).

Have fun!
