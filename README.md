# Materials  for MaX  QE-2021 online school

This repository collects all the tutorials and the slides used during the 
*_MaX School on Advanced Materials and Molecular Modelling with Quantum ESPRESSO_* held online from 17 to 28
May 2021. 

## Structure of the hands-on excercises

For each day, the respective hands-on exercises are located in
`Day-X/` folder, where `X` is the day number. Each `Day-X/` folder
contains the `README.md` file, which is a very short description of
exercises, and the `handson-dayX.pdf` file that contains slides, which
describe the hands-on exercises in more detail.

For each day, the exercises are located within the `Day-X/` directory
and are numbered sequentially. For example, here is the structure of
the `Day-2/` folder:

```
Day-2/
  README.md
  handson-day2.pdf
  example1.Si/
  example2.Al/
  example3.Fe/
```

## Filename convention

For the logic/convention of how the files are (should be) named, see file [Day-1/README-filenames.md](./Day-1/README-filenames.md).
